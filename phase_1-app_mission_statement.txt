IDEA
For a functioning democracy, it is paramount that voters have quick access to accurate, basic civic information.
Voters search for their state and are given their legislators' by name, any upcoming votes and contact information, as well as campaign finance details.
Creating a voter-centric tool organized around the basic mechanism of local politics allows for careful scrutiny of a representatives' legislative actions.
